It was to us! But we've found that there's an <a title="Google Search &quot;Roadschooling&quot;" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=roadschool&amp;oq=roadschool&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j0l2j69i60j0.3552j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=91&amp;espv=210&amp;q=roadschooling&amp;safe=active" target="_blank">entire subculture in America</a> of roadschoolers who are criss-crossing the US and learning along the way.</p>

<p>Roadschooling is basically homeschooling on the road. Consequently, there's no one "style" of learning or teaching that would be called roadschooling. For our family, homeschooling and roadschooling look pretty much the same.</p><br>

<a href="http://www.mckinleyarts.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-401" alt="McKinley-School-Pasadena-Ext-19101" src="http://oneyearroadtrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mckinley-school-pasadena-ext-19101.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="238"  style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></a><p>Since our kids first started their formal education our kids have been in <a href="http://www.pusd.us/" target="_blank">public schools in Pasadena</a> and we have LOVED it. We've been so happy with the quality of their education, their teachers, peers and their learning environments. Obviously, no school is perfect, and we've faced our challenges, too. But because we're experiencing so many new things with this road trip, we decided we should try to ease into learning at home BEFORE hitting the road. So, while we are still living in Pasadena we are practicing homeschooling and we are loving it.</p>

<p>Granted, we've had our trepidations. We (the parents) have both been teachers in public and private schools and enjoy teaching. But would it be the same with our OWN kids--and with just a classroom size of 3 (or 1 when we're teaching math)? What IS a classroom at home? Where do we get the curriculum? How do we know that the kids are learning all they need to learn? What if we fail them and they end up dropping out of middle school and joining the circus and live the rest of their lives as carnies manning the tilt-a-whirl and dipping frozen bananas into dusty vats of stale peanuts...what are we doing to our sweet adorable kids? AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!</p><br>

<a href="http://nomadicsimplicity.com/new-roadschooling-year-begins/" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-398 alignleft" alt="roadschool-on" src="http://oneyearroadtrip.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/roadschool-on.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="128"  style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></a><p>And then we breathed. And we realized that, no matter how hard we tried, we probably couldn't ruin our kids just by home/roadschooling them for a couple years.</p>

<p>In fact, we love it. We've never got to spend so much time together. We love teaching them. They love learning. We know (or are learning) how best they learn and can adapt lessons, assignments and teaching methods to them.</p>

<p>Is it perfect? Uh, no. Will we continue once we return? Maybe. Probably not more than another year. Will we ruin them? No. Will they ruin us. We sure hope so.</p>

<p>Trust us. We're learning more about life and ourselves through them than any other way. We're being rebuilt every day. Better. Stronger. More powerful...ok, we're not Robocop or a farm truck. But we're learning alongside them and it's great.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the resources we've found that we LOVE primarily because they are things we can use both homeschooling in Pasadena AND roadschooling across the US:</p><br>

<h4>The Library Video Company</h4>
<a href="http://www.libraryvideo.com/browse/sm_allseries.asp?mscssid=NC0FEHGU5DTQ9GA0HTJ4KBL4DFFMAX6F" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-404" alt="Schlessinger" src="http://oneyearroadtrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/schlessinger.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="105" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/></a>
<p>Amazing and endless series of videos about anything and everything our kids are interested in, and they are a fun way to help us meet <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/" target="_blank">Common Core Standards</a>. And most of them come with teacher guides and/or student guides. Super cool. We love them. Many libraries subscribe so they're FREE. BOOM!</p><br>

<h4>McGraw-Hill Online PDFs</h4>
<p>Don't ask us how or why these links are public. Just Google them, download them, enjoy them and ease your mind about how the heck-fire you're going to teach your 2nd, 3rd and 5th graders about grammar all at the same time. So far, all the grades we've found line up perfectly. So while Evie's learning what a noun is, Solveig's learning what a proper noun is and Jack's working with nouns as parts of predicates...and they have spelling, too. BOOM-DIGGITY!</p><br>

<h4>Public Library</h4><a href="http://oneyearroadtrip.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pasadena_public_library_1927.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-397 alignleft" alt="Pasadena_Public_Library_1927" src="http://oneyearroadtrip.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pasadena_public_library_1927.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="178" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/></a>
<p>Duh. It's free. It's everywhere. The librarians typically like helping you. And many have <a href="http://cityofpasadena.libguides.com/hastingshomeschoolguide" target="_blank">homeschool resources</a> right there on site, including microscopes, skeletons, models, curricula, etc. Did we mention it's free?</p>
<h4>Museums, Aquariums, Botanical Gardens, State Parks, National Parks...</h4>
<p>There are way too many amazing things about all of these to list, so we'll just list some places we've been this year so far knowing that we're just getting started with our first year of homeschooling...</p>

<p>Huntington Library and Gardens, <strong>California Science Center</strong>, Pasadena Museum of History, <strong>Angeles National Forest</strong>, Santa Monica Beach, <strong>Seal Beach</strong>, Napa Valley, <strong>San Gabriel Mission</strong>, Santa Barbara Mission, <strong>Eaton Canyon Nature Center</strong>, Point Lobos State Reserve, <strong>Calaveras Big Trees State Park</strong>, California Caverns State Historic Landmark, <strong>Columbia State Park</strong>...where to next?</p>
