<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>To create a new generation of altruistic, empathetic, courageous people--a Generation of Generosity</p><br>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>To help kids realize their dreams of transforming their communities by providing resources for enacting change and inspiration from other Kid Change-Makers</p><br>
<h4>Our Goals</h4>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">PHASE 1:</p>
<p>1) Create One Year Road Trip, a multi-media documentary project shared in real-time, tracking the Webbs, a family of 5 unique storytellers, as we crisscross America to illuminate the stories of Kid Change-Makers who are making the world a better place.</p>
<p>2) Partner with a psychologist from Fuller School of Psychology on a developmental research project to better understand how a Generation of Generosity might be created.</p>
<p>3) Create curriculum guides to empower kids &amp; their communities to bring positive change.</p><br>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">PHASE 2:</p>
<p>Develop replicable ecosystems of children &amp; communities who, through empathy &amp; action, create a sustainable MOVEMENT of change in the world.</p><br>
<h4>Our Values</h4>
<p>Creativity : Empowerment : Generosity : Empathy : Adventure</p><br>
<h4>Life on the Road?</h4>
<p>Yep! We’re squeezing our family of 5 into our new cozy home, a 1985 RV school bus. We’ll be living “local-only” by connecting with locally owned restaurants and business entrepreneurs--getting a taste of small town America--wherever rubber meets the road.</p><br>
<h4>The Big Challenge?</h4>
<p>How will we as a family, ignite a movement that inspires other kids and families to make a difference in their own personal corners of the world?</p><br>
<h4>Who's the Crew?</h4>
<p>It’s us! Our 3 inquisitive kids (Jack, Solveig &amp; Evie) have their iPads aimed and ready to shoot, interview and inspire our online audience, while we parents (Matt &amp; Eva) handle the professional film equipment to capture our adventure.</p><br>
<h4>When?</h4>
<p>The journey has already begun! We’re currently shooting kid interviews in our own community of Los Angeles, California. Our YouTube channel is live, and vlogging, Tweeting, Intstagramming and Facebook posting are all a part of our daily lives as we gear up to hit the road in June 2014.</p><br>
<h4>Why Spend a Year on the Road?</h4>
<p>We want to be “Change-Makers”, and that begins with an intentional, personal connection.</p>
<p>As children, we parents -- Matt and Eva -- were dramatically shaped by experiences we had with our own families serving the poor face-to-face. We believe it is essential for our family to live a life of purposeful engagement. In order to understand these amazing children and their causes, we must plunge ourselves into their communities, and get to know these heroes of today’s Kid Nation -- those leading the way to a better tomorrow. One Year Road Trip will allow us to come alongside and illuminate kid-driven, life-giving causes all across the country, and further their impact in the world.</p>
<p>There are a lot of stories to tell, and our lives will be changed in the process. We hope for a better future. And it all begins with an intentional, personal connection.</p><br>
