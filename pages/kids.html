<p><strong>Max</strong>  was 5 years-old when his mom's best friend died of breast cancer. That October he asked to have a lemonade stand to raise money for breast cancer research. TEN years later he's still doing it and has raised more than $100,000! <a title="Max's Lemonade Stand" href="http://www.maxslemonadestand.com/" target="_blank">Check out Max's site</a> and support the cause!</p><br>
